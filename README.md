— INSPIRATION — 
* “Who Here Has Bought a Home Before Utilizing a Real Estate Agent?”

* “Typically -	“Find an Agent”
				“Interview, Chat to get to know you”

	“They conduct the search and just give you access to the results.”

	“Intention:	“Give Client’s the power to choose an Agent without hassle”
				“Conduct Searches that are shared with Agents”
